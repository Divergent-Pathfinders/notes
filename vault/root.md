## Welcome to Divergent Pathfinders

We're a group of people _doing good different_ and the emerging edges. You'll find information about the community, what we're up to, and how you can join in. You'll also find a growing toolkit for doing exploratory, boundary-blurring work that engages with big, tangled, messy problems.

These pages contain information about how you can join in with the community. For now, the best way to find out more is to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/vFWqz3PRzQ).

You can also find the techie side of the project, like this website, on [our Github page](https://github.com/Divergent-Pathfinders).

This community is just starting up. If you're interested but not quite ready to join, then please sign up to our mailing list for updates.

## Who is this for?

Divergent Pathfinders is a space for people who have two qualities which - in the right circumstances - allow them to do wonderful things. Unfortunately, the right circumstances aren't very common. This space is intended to both provide such circumstance, and develop effective practice around providing it to others.

### Subtle Divergence

Subtly divergent people experience the world in significantly different ways to those around them. They feel, think, and do unconventional things. This can include people who are neurodivergent, LGBTQ+, gender divergent, and/or from a different culture to those around them. The different perspective, sensibilities and capabilities that subtly divergent people possess allows them to see and work with things others do not.

### Compassionate Connection

Compassionate connectors see the world in a linky, big-picture, intuitive way. They tend to work with people and/or other living beings and the relationships those beings rely upon. They have an intuitive instinct for complexity and are drawn to messy, tangled problems. The intuitive ability to see through the tangle and work with problems others find overwhelmingly complex is some of the most valuable work compassionate connectors can do for themselves and others.

## What's next?

After experimenting with lots of online community platforms, it became obvious none could support the kind of co-created, collaborative, open work that this community is built on. So, we're building our own. Or, at least, assembling it from parts other people have built. We'll be documenting the process and releasing any code we write as part of the process.

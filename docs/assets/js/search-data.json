You'll find information about the community, what we're up to, and how you can join in. You'll also find a growing toolkit for doing exploratory, boundary-blurring work that engages with big, tangled, messy problems.\n\nThese pages contain information about how you can join in with the community. For now, the best way to find out more is to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/vFWqz3PRzQ).\n\nYou can also find the techie side of the project, like this website, on [our Github page](https://github.com/Divergent-Pathfinders).\n\nThis community is just starting up. If you're interested but not quite ready to join, then please sign up to our mailing list for updates.\n\n<script async data-uid=\"6968787dc9\" src=\"https://meaningbit.ck.page/6968787dc9/index.js\"></script>\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nDivergent Pathfinders is a space for people who have two qualities which - in the right circumstances - allow them to do wonderful things. Unfortunately, the right circumstances aren't very common. This space is intended to both provide such circumstance, and develop effective practice around providing it to others.\n\n### Subtle Divergence\n\nSubtly divergent people experience the world in significantly different ways to those around them. They feel, think, and do unconventional things. This can include people who are neurodivergent, LGBTQ+, gender divergent, and/or from a different culture to those around them. The different perspective, sensibilities and capabilities that subtly divergent people possess allows them to see and work with things others do not.\n\n### Compassionate Connection\n\nCompassionate connectors see the world in a linky, big-picture, intuitive way. They tend to work with people and/or other living beings and the relationships those beings rely upon. They have an intuitive instinct for complexity and are drawn to messy, tangled problems. The intuitive ability to see through the tangle and work with problems others find overwhelmingly complex is some of the most valuable work compassionate connectors can do for themselves and others.\n\n## What's next?\n\nAfter experimenting with lots of online community platforms, it became obvious none could support the kind of co-created, collaborative, open work that this community is built on. So, we're building our own. Or, at least, assembling it from parts other people have built. We'll be documenting the process and releasing any code we write as part of the process.","url":"https://www.divergentpathfinders.com","relUrl":"/"},{"doc":"Events","title":"Events","hpath":"events","content":"\nThe community runs regular events for groups within the community, members, and for the public.
